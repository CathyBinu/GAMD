# GAMD
This work showcases the application of Graph neural networks (GNN) to simulation particle systems. A neural network architecture called GNN Accelerated Molecular Dynamics(GAMD) is implemented here. 
This model is trained and tested on the data collected from Molecular Dynamics Simulation (MDS) of the Lennnard Jones (LJ) system using the OpenMM library.
